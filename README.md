# LeetCode Solutions

## Author: Shikhar Partap Singh

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! In this repository, I will be sharing my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Please note that I will implement only the functions required to solve the problems, not the entire code.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem is contained within its own directory.
- Within each problem directory, you will find:
  - The problem statement.
  - My solution implementation in Java.
  - Any additional files or resources relevant to the problem.

## Getting Started

To use my solutions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the problem you are interested in.
3. Open the Java file containing the solution implementation.
4. Copy the code and use it as needed in your own projects.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while I strive to provide accurate and efficient solutions, my solutions may not always be the most optimal. I encourage you to understand the problem and its constraints before using any solution.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!

Happy coding!
